                        <p>Together with a couple of friends, we visited Jamestown (Accra, Ghana) and interacted with the residents of this historic city to better
                            understand their culture and ways of live. The long term goal was to find ways in which these people could benefit more from the huge
                            number of tourists that visist Jamestown each year, while at thesame time making the tourist experience world class. I did like this project,
                            but sometimes the long days under the Accra sun were dreadful.

                        <p>This was a class project for the most hated FDE. But it was fun for my team and I. Our goal was to provide the high school children in Ayim
                            with the required information to dream big. Through career sesssions, tutorial sessions and games, we sought to improve the student's 
                            ambition and drive to work hard. I really enjoyed our group presentations in class, especially the one in which Joshua Opoku took one or
                            two bullets for the team. Keneth Azortibah was a gem, man!

                        <p>Using Matplotlib and Python, I built a library management system that could be run with much ease from the command line. The system allowed
                            Library administrators to register in books in several ways, thereby making the task easier. For example, a librarian could register a new book
                            by typing out the details in an interactive promppt, or by feeding an excel sheet as input. Matplotlib also enabled me to include some basic 
                            data analysis with beautiful graphs.

                        <p>I fell in love with Edsgar W. Dijkstra by reading about his many idiosyncracies on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra">Wikipedia</a>
                            and I was so excited when I decided to implement his algorithm as part of a project I was working on with the great Percy Brown. We got data from some website
                            about all the airports and air routes, and based on a user's points of departure and destination will suggest the connecting flights to book to travel
                            the least distance. We could have also gotten information about the prices to suggest the cheapest flights.

                        <p>I built a python to do some linear algebra computations. This stuff saved my life some day when I was doing an assignment. I had computed the echelon

                            I had a "calculator" that could solve such problems. I went on to use the calculator and I found the problem much faster.

                            the cool projects and now I had to build a database for the electoral commision. The project ended being fun, as I had complex relationships and very
                            few traps to resolve.
