                        <p>Being a Math tutor was fun. I had to help people when they got stuck with an assignment or could not understand something in class. 
                            The only bad thing with being a Math tutor is that people tend to come to you when you are under immense pressure yourself from school.
                            When the semester is young, many people don't know who a Math Tutor is, so to speak. Let the Mid-Semester schedule be sent out, boy. Rush

                        <p>My very first position as a secretary general. It is a little bit challenging, as I am really not the person you want to keep you posted
                            with deadlines and reminders. But it has been a fun experience thus far. I have gained so many interpersonal skills and met lots of people.
                            I have also learned one or two more things about planning events. I used to suck at that till recently, and I am grateful for how much improvement
                            I have made.
